# beam-analysis
This Project is a Python script for calculating support reactions, Shear force and Bending moment values of Simply supported beams.

## Features
- Handles multiple **point loads**
- Handles multiple **uniformly distributed loads**
- Handles multiple **uniformly varying loads**
- Supports **point moments**
-  Prints results as a table (position,shear force,bending moments)

## How to run
1. Install Pyhton (3.8 or later )
2. Clone this repository:
   '''bash
   git clone https://github.com/Somashekhara013/beam-analysis
